# Hisibot
Hisibot is HIpertensi BOT (Hypertension BOT). I'm working on this project with my team for PENSFEST 2022.
The hisibot system is based on IoT using : 
1. esp32
2. mpx5100dp (air pressure sensor)
3. XDC-85 (heart rate sensor)
4. oled

The output data from this system is in the form of blood pressure and heart rate. 
The data will be stored in firebase and sent to the application.
